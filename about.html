      <h4>Paranoia!</h4>
      <p>Collection of commands to round various shape attributes to the closest decimal. A width of 1.23 inches becomes 1.2 inches. Select the elements to apply transformation to or select the slide to apply transformation to all elements.</p>
      <h4>Copy</h4>
      <p>Collection of commands to copy attributes from the last selected shape to the others. This mimics Microsoft PowerPoint's behavior to apply the same attribute to multiple shapes, which Google Slides does not support.</p>
      <h4>Adjoin</h4>
      <p>Collection of commands to place shapes side by side and align them to the center of the leftmost or topmost element.</p>
      <h4>Align to inner and outer edges</h4>
      <p>Collection of alignment commands to arrange shapes always using the last selected object as the reference.</p>
      <h4>Flip</h4>
      <p>Commands to swap position of the last two selected shapes.</p>
